# Reference vs Copy

---

The "JavaScript Reference vs Copy" project is part of Wes Bos's "JavaScript30" challenge series. In this particular project, participants learn about the difference between referencing and copying objects and arrays in JavaScript.

The project consists of a series of coding challenges that gradually introduce concepts related to referencing and copying in JavaScript. Participants will learn how to create new arrays and objects that are copies of existing ones, as well as how to reference existing arrays and objects without creating new ones.

Throughout the project, participants will work with various built-in JavaScript methods and operators, including slice(), spread syntax, and Object.assign(). They will also learn how to identify when an object or array is being referenced versus when it is being copied.
